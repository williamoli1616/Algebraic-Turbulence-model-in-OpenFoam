This repository contains the C++ source code and implementation of an algebraic turbulence model for OpenFOAM, based on a fixed mixing-length approach.
A detailed step-by-step guide is provided to walk through the entire implementation process.
While tailored to this specific model, the structure is general and reusable for anyone looking to implement custom turbulence models via source code editing in OpenFOAM.
